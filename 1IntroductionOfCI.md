# This lesson focuses on the background of CI and its key practices #

In this course, the trainer will first introduce the background of CI, establish common understanding of the problem domain, then the key practices of CI will be presented and explained, with interaction around real project problems. At the last stage, we will give a short introduction of CruiseControl and its wide usage, the advantage and disadvantage and then the rise of Cruise, why you need it.

  * History of Continuous Integration (CI) and problems it focuses on
  * What is CI and how can it helps
  * Key practices of CI
  * Introduction of CruiseControl
  * Why Cruise
  * Core features in Cruise

  * History
> Continuous Integration is a fundamental practice in modern software development. In early  days, integration is a long and unpredictable process. Besides that, bugs were  found in a deferred manner, thus a lot of time was wasted in development-test cycle. You don't know  how long you will need to release software. Team members were depressed.

  * one of the most awkward and tense moment: integration
  * individual modules worked but the whole failed
  * nowadays in most projects it's not a pain point any more

  * What is CI
> If you run into a painful activity, a good tip is to do it more often.

> Thus came the "Continuous Integration" practice, which encourages frequent integration and automated build at the point that software is committed to version control system.

> CI helps in the following points:
  * find bugs more quicker
  * reduce risks
  * improve project visibility

> Originally CI is focused in software construction, but as time goes on people extend the meaning of CI to stages after development - testing and deploying software until it goes to production. Advanced level of enterprise CI covers most of the stages in software lifecycle, from development to production.
